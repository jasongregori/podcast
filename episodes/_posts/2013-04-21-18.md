subtitle: You're on Thin Lava Crust
desc: You've waited, you've wondered, you've cried yourself to sleep; but wait no longer! The Weekly Once-a-Week is back after 9 bleak and desparate months. No longer must you face another day alone, John and Jason return to battle the sour smell of boredom. Tread lightly my friends, you're on thin lava crust.
